## Functional Fundamentals and Way of Reasoning

This first chapter introduces important functional programming jargon and illustrates some fundamental notions of the paradigm.

### First class values

Values are expressions that cannot be evaluated any further. Technically speaking they are expressions in normal form (NF). In Javascript we can represent values of most data types in literal form:

```javascript
"foo"
123
true
[1, 2, 3]
{foo: "bar"}
a => a
/^[A-Z]$/
```
You can pass values to and return them from functions. This trait is referred to as first class. Values are first class entities.

### First class expressions

Values are the most fundamental entity of programming but not particularly useful on their own. Fortunately we can generalize them to expressions. Generally speaking (pun intended) the process of generalization means to make things more useful, i.e. applicable to a wide range of scenarios.

```javascript
"foo" + "bar"
123 â€“ 1
true && false
[1, 2, 3] [0]
({foo: "bar"}).foo
(a => a) ("foo")
```
Expressions are also first class. However, in Javascript there is no difference between them and values in this regard, since expressions are always evaluated before they are passed to or returned from a function. Other languages pursue different evaluation strategies. Functional languages sometimes have a call-by-need strategy, in which an expression is only evaluated when it is actually needed. Expressions are a great improvement compared to mere values. But we can only use them ad-hoc, that is in place and as is. Is there a way to make them less ad-hoc? Let us generalize further!

### First class functions

Imagine named expressions with holes in them and a mechanism to fill these holes when needed. Such generalized expressions would be way more flexible, because their results vary by means of the provided values. I am obviously talking about functions. Since functions are just expressions with holes in them they are also first class entities.

```javascript
const foo = hole => `expression with a ${hole} in it`;
foo("bar") // expression
```
We can call `foo` once, twice, several times or not at all. It is only evaluated when needed. This is similar to the call-by-need evaluation strategy I mentioned above. Functions are lazy evaluated by design.

The ability to reuse functions allows us to compose them, provided the involved types match. Using composition we can create more complex functions out of simpler ones, which further increase their reusability.

```javascript
add(length("foo")) (length("bar"))
```
When functions are just first class expressions with holes in them, what differentiates them from, say, literals or other expressions? Nothing really, except that they are more general. This is exactly how we regard functions in functional programming: they are just ordinary values and we treat them accordingly.

### Pure functions

Admittedly, I oversimplified a bit. In fact three restrictions are necessary in order for functions to be able to act like ordinary values:

* they must return a result value no matter what arguments are provided
* they must return the same result value for the same arguments
* they must not perform another visible effect than creating and returning a result value

The first restriction forms total functions and we are going to discuss them in the next paragraph. The latter two constitute pure functions. A pure function must be deterministic and must not perform visible side effects so that you can substitute its invocations with the respective result values without changing the behavior of the program. In the literature this restriction is called referential transparency. Only such pure functions can be regarded as ordinary values.

These two related questions frequently come up on the topic:

* if a function declaration includes impure expressions but the effect(s) are not visible outside the function scope, calling it can be still considered a pure expression
* if an otherwise pure function depends on an impure one it is also impure, because impurity is infectious

### Idempotent functions

Functions for which applies `f(f(x)) === f(x)` are referred to as idempotent ones. Idempotence is a desirable property, because it allows an at-least-once semantics as opposed to excatly once. Idempotence is orthogonal to purity, i.e. an idempotent function must not be pure and vice versa:

```javascript
const toUC = s => s.toUpperCase(),
  inc = x => x + 1,
  delFoo = o => (delete o["foo"], o),
  log = x => (console.log(x), x),
  o = {foo: 123, bar: "abc"};
  
// idempotent pure function
toUC(toUC("hey")) === toUC("hey"); // true

// non-idempotent pure function
inc(inc(0)) === inc(0); // false

// idempotent impure function
delFoo(delFoo(o)).toString() === delFoo(o).toString(); // true

// non-idempotent impure function
log(log("foo")); // logs twice
log("foo"); // logs once
```
As you can see even an impure function can be idempotent in its side effect.

### Total and partial functions

The functional paradigm considers functions as mappings from domain (arguments) to codomain (result values). If every argument (or set of arguments) yields a result value we are talking about total functions. Otherwise it is a partial one:

```javascript
const head = xs => xs[0];
head([1, 2, 3]); // 1
head([]); // undefined
```
`head` is a partial function because it returns undefined in certain cases, which indicates a type error. You should either avoid such functions or throw an error explicitly instead of silently returning `undefined`. Partial functions are per se less predictable and reliable than total functions.

You can transform any partial function into a total one by using the `Option` type. `Option` is one of the most common functional types. It will be covered in a later chapter.

### Higher order functions

We are not done generalizing. If functions are just first class values let us pass a function to another one and see what is happening:

```javascript
const app = f => x => f(x);
const add = x => y => x + y;
const sub = x => y => x â€“ y;

app(add) (2) (3) // 5
app(sub) (2) (3) // -1
```
What we are doing here is a kind of dependency injection. Such functions are called higher order functions, because they expect at least one function argument. Consequently functions without a function argument are called first order functions.

Please note that a function without function arguments that returns another function is not a higher order function but a curried one. We will deal with currying in a later chapter of this course.

You can most likely imagine how powerful higher order functions are, since they are so generalized. As I have already mentioned the process of generalization means to make things more useful.

### Are statements harmful?

No, but they are like dead ends in your code, because they are decoupled from one another. Since they do not evaluate to a value you need to bind their (intermediate) results to names explicitly in order to use them in other statements. As a result you have to declare a lot of name bindings to store all these accruing intermediate values:

```javascript
const x = 1 + 2;
const y = 2 + 3;
const z = x * y;
```
I use the term name binding instead of variable, because there is no such thing as a variable in functional programming. All we can do is bind immutable values to names. Name bindings themselves are also immutable, i.e. you cannot reassign them. In Javascript, however, this is just a policy we need to adhere to.

Later in this course you will see that statements obstruct the functional control flow, which consists of various forms of function composition.

### Are operators special?

In functional programming operators are just functions in infix position (e.g. `x + y`), which have a predefined precedence and associativity. Functons on the other hand are ususally written in prefix notation (e.g. `add(x) (y)`) and their application is left-associative and has a higher precedence then every other operator.

Some functional programming languages allow to partially apply operators, which is referred to as left and right sectioning. Others even allow to declare custom operators with their own precedence and associativity. As you can see there should be nothing special about operators. Unfortunately in Javascript operators are special and are not first class. So we have to imitate their behavior with functions.

### Local reasoning

We have learned about referential transparency, which is a rather technical and abstract term. What does RT ultimatively give us? Well, it enables us to reason locally about our code. Local reasoning means we can think about an expression, which is deeply burried in our program's structure without being concerned about the context. In the absence of side effects we can indeed forget about the context and focus on the portion of code we are interested in. This is an incredible strong idea and it scales with the size of your program. Along with the general idea of composition it represents the main benefit you can experience as a functional programmer.

### Equational reasoning

Another way of thinking which is promoted by functional programming is equational reasoning. It starts with the simple arithmetic laws

```
(a + b) + c = a + (b + c) // associative law
a + b = b + a // commutative law
a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c // distributive law
```
and goes on with more complex laws associatived to certain patterns and data types, like identity, composition or the homomorphism law. Equational reasoning allows various transformation of code and the result just works as expected. It requires a lot of experience so hang in there.
