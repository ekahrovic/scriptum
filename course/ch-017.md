## Combining Effects with Actions using Monad

### The limitation of applicative

In the chapter about applicatives we have learned that an applicative effect may depend on a previous effect but we cannot control an effect depending on a previous value. It turns out that despite this limitation applicative computations are applicable for a surprising number of scenarios. However, they are not always enough. We need a slightly less general, slightly more expressive alternative.

### Extending `Applicative` by `Monad`

Provided you have understood applicative functors it is only a minor step to comprehend monads. Their sole purpose is to overcome the limitation of applicatives. Before we take a close look into the `Monad` type class we will ascertain what they are not:

_Monads are no means to handle side effects!_

There are special types that do this. Monad and applicative are just two ways to combine these types.

#### From pure functions to actions

So far we lifted n-ary functions into the context of `n` applicative values. If the next effect should depend on the previous value we need more than a pure function. We need one that returns a value in an effectul context of the same type. This type of function is called action. An action is not impure but it may represent an effectful computation provided it is used in the right place:

```javascript
// pure function
const foo = x => x + 1;

// action
const bar = x => [x + 1];
```
We will learn during this chapter what this right place is.

#### The `join` operation

If we apply an action with a functorial value we get back a nested functor:

```javascript
const arrFold = f => init => xs => {
  let acc = init;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (xs[i], i);

  return acc;
};

const arrAppend = xs => ys =>
  (xs.push.apply(xs, ys), xs);

const arrEmpty = () => [];

// Functor

const arrMap = f => xs =>
  xs.map((x, i) => f(x, i));

// MAIN

arrMap(x => [x, x])
  ([1, 2, 3]); // [[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]]
```

We need a way to join two effectul contexts, which is a non-deterministic computation in this case, into one:

```javascript
// Monad

const arrJoin = xs =>
  arrFold(arrAppend)
    (arrEmpty())
      (xs);

// MAIN

arrJoin(
  arrMap(x => [x, x])
    ([1, 2, 3])); // [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/FragrantSugaryObjectpool)

In other functional languages `join` is combined with `map` and referred to as `flatmap`. Please note that `join` is not about flattening arrays. It is about joining two effectful contexts, which is far more general.

#### The `chain` operation

`chain` takes an effectful context from a previous functorial computation and an action, transforms the value(s) inside the context and returns a new context of the same type with the transformed value(s) inside.

TODO: show `chain`/`join` isomorphism

#### Monadic laws

### Value-effect dependency

Given are two effectul computations `F<A>` and `F<B>`. It applies:

```
F   is an effectul context
A/B are values inside effectful contexts
~   denotes a "x may depend on y" relation
-   denotes a "x depends on y" relation
</> denotes the direction of an dependency

Applicative allows:
F <~ F

Monad allows:
F <- F
A <~ F
```
### Monads at the type level

```
<   A, B>( f:   (x: A) => B ) => ( x:   A ) =>   B ; // function application
<F, A, B>( f:   (x: A) => B ) => (tx: F<A>) => F<B>; // functor lifting
<F, A, B>(tf: F<(x: A) => B>) => (tx: F<A>) => F<B>; // applicative lifting
<M, A, B>(ft: (x: A) => M<B>) => (tx: M<A>) => M<B>; // monadic joining
```
